# abalone-age-prediction
Context

Determining an abalone's age involves counting the number of rings in a cross-section of the shell through a microscope. Since this method is somewhat cumbersome and complex, you are interested in helping the farmers estimate the age of the abalone using its physical characteristics.

Abalone characteristics:

"sex" - M, F, and I (infant).
"length" - longest shell measurement.
"diameter" - perpendicular to the length.
"height" - measured with meat in the shell.
"wholewt" - whole abalone weight. "shuckedwt" - the weight of abalone meat.
"viscerawt" - gut-weight. "shellwt" - the weight of the dried shell.
"rings" - number of rings in a shell cross-section.
"age" - the age of the abalone: the number of rings + 1.5.
